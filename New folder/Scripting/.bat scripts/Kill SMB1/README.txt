Disables SMB1 via regedit. Use on any unpatched win 8 and below OS. Shit, run it on 10. I don't care. I'm not your mother. 

SMB1 is a 30 year old legacy protocol for oooold printers and hardware to connect, but is a HUGE vulnerability. It's what the wannacry malware
used. Isn't used by anything modern, has no reason to be enabled. Run this on ANY new win7 image
